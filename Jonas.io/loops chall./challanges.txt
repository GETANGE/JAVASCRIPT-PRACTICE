FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

Prime Numbers: Write a program to determine if a given number is prime (only divisible by 1 and itself). Generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit.

Factorial: Write a program to calculate the factorial of a given number using a loop.

Palindrome Check: Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Pattern Printing: Use loops to print patterns, such as the right-angled triangle, inverted triangle, or a pyramid.

Sum of Digits: Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a given number.

GCD and LCM: Write a program to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

Armstrong Number: Write a program to check if a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits).

Multiplication Table: Generate the multiplication table for a given number.

Collatz Sequence: Write a program to generate the Collatz sequence for a given number, which follows these rules: if the number is even, divide it by 2; if it's odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Palindrome Number: Write a program to check if a given number is a palindrome.

Count Vowels and Consonants: Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a given string.

Binary to Decimal Conversion: Write a program to convert a binary number to its decimal equivalent.
